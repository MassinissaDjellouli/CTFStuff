### Python:
- If the input is a number:
  - Try passing inf,-inf or NaN
    - ex: 1 + NaN = NaN
  
### PHP:
- PHP supports loose comparaison
  - If a string starts with 0e and is followed only by numbers, it is equal to 0, or 1e = 1
    - Considered as scientific notation. 0^numbers = 0 and 1^numbers = 1
